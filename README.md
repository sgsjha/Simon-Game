## ✨ Overview

Simon Sound Memory is a classic colour-and-sound memory game recreated for iPhone. A sequence of tones and lights plays — your goal is to repeat it back perfectly. Each round adds a new step, making the challenge grow rapidly.

A simple idea. A dangerously addictive game loop.

## 🧠 Game Logic

Step 1: When the game starts, a colour is randomly chosen and flashed with its sound.
Step 2: The player must repeat the exact sequence by tapping colours.
Step 3: On a successful round, the game adds one new random colour to the sequence.
Step 4: If the player gets the sequence wrong → Game Over.
Step 5: High score is compared and stored if beaten.

The sequence grows exponentially more difficult — testing memory, reaction speed, and pattern recognition.
