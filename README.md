I made this game as a part of my assignment for COMP 228 - App Development

Basic Game Logic:
● The game is a fun memory game in which the a randomly generated sequence of colours/sounds has to be followed.
● Each round, the number of colours in the sequence is increased by one, making it even more challenging.

Game features:
● The home screen provides an easy to understand UI, and contains the play button
● Tapping the play button, starts the game
● Each colour has a different sound that is played when that colour is highlighted
● Then the user taps the colours in the sequence they were played.
● If the user fails to do so, its Game over and a restart button appears to play again.
● If the user manages to beat the highscore, he is greeted with the ‘New High score’ text
making him aware of his achievement.
● The highscore is then saved using a persistent data storage mechanism
